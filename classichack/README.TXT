DSi Classic Word Games exploit

This little project allows you to compile assembly straight into a
Classic Word Games save game file. This file can then be written to the game
card with something like eepinator from a normal DS.

The current assembly just paints the screens red.

If you find anything interesting then let us know in #dsdev on irc.blitzed.org

With thanks to Blasty for pointing me at modifying desmume to test exploit code.
Basically I added code to check the program counter for particular values which I
then added to the save file until it went bang.
 
Have fun,
